## Bayesian inference

-   data ($\mathcal{D}$)
-   parameters ($\theta$)

::: {.absolute top="40%" left="15%"}
$$Pr(\theta| \mathcal{D}) = \frac{Pr(\mathcal{D} | \theta) \times Pr(\theta)}{\int Pr(\mathcal{D} | \theta) \times Pr(\theta) \mathrm{d}\theta}$$

# How to obtain posterior distribution?

## Posterior based on closed-form 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

![](figures/integration_example.png)

- but we have to deal with integration
- and our flexibility is rather limited
  - only relatively simple models
  - only *conjugate* priors

## Posterior based on approximation

-  grid approximation
-  quadratic approximation or other optimization
-  Variational Bayesian methods

## Posterior based on simulations

```{r}
tibble(x= seq(-4, 4, length.out=100)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x))+
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, geom="polygon", fill="blue", alpha=1/2)+
    ggtitle("Normal distribution", subtitle = "based on known formula")+
  theme_classic()
```

## Posterior based on simulations

```{r}
tibble(x= rnorm(10000, mean=0, sd=1)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x))+
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, geom="polygon", fill="blue", alpha=1/2)+
  geom_histogram(colour="black", fill="blue", alpha=1/2)+
    ggtitle("Normal distribution", subtitle = "based on 10000 simulations")+
  theme_classic()
```

## Markov chain Monte Carlo

- MCMC involves a number of algorithms based on a similar idea:
  - Metropolis, Metropolis-Hastings, Gibbs
  - Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, NUTS
- Its aim is to sample from a complex and high-dimensional probability distribution...
- By repeatedly generating a new sample from a proposal distribution, and accepting or rejecting it based on a certain acceptance probability


## Markov chain Monte Carlo

```{r}
library(bayesplot)
x <- example_mcmc_draws(1, 1)
mcmc_trace(x)+
  ggtitle("A traceplot of 250 draws from a posterior distribution")
```

## Markov chain Monte Carlo

```{r}
mcmc_hist(x)+
  ggtitle("A histogram of 250 draws from a posterior distribution")
```
## Markov chain Monte Carlo

```{r}
mcmc_dens(x)+
  ggtitle("A density plot of 250 draws from a posterior distribution")
```

# Describing posterior distribution

## Centrality - mean

```{r}
mcmc_dens(x)+
  geom_vline(xintercept = -21.06, colour="red")+
  ggtitle("A density plot of 250 draws from a posterior distribution",
          subtitle = "with the red line denoting posterior mean")
```

## Centrality - MAP estimate

```{r}
mcmc_dens(x)+
  geom_vline(xintercept = -24.17, colour="green")+
  ggtitle("A density plot of 250 draws from a posterior distribution",
          subtitle = "with the green line denoting maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) estimate")
```

## Centrality - median

```{r}
mcmc_dens(x)+
  geom_vline(xintercept = -22.14, colour="blue")+
  ggtitle("A density plot of 250 draws from a posterior distribution",
          subtitle = "with the green line denoting median")
```
## Uncertainty - credible intervals

```{r}
mcmc_dens(x)+
  geom_polygon(data=tibble(Value=c(-46.58, 10.13, 10.13, -46.58), y=c(0,0,0.029,0.029)), aes(y=y), fill="yellow", alpha=1/3)+
  ggtitle("A density plot of 250 draws from a posterior distribution",
          subtitle = "with the yellow are denoting equal-tailed 95% credible interval [-46.58, 10.13]")
```

## Uncertainty - highest density intervals

```{r}
mcmc_dens(x)+
  geom_polygon(data=tibble(Value=c(-46.70, 10.31, 10.31, -46.70), y=c(0,0,0.029,0.029)), aes(y=y), fill="cyan", alpha=1/3)+
  ggtitle("A density plot of 250 draws from a posterior distribution",
          subtitle = "with the cyan area denoting 95% highest density interval [-46.70, 10.31]")
```

## Uncertainty - highest density intervals

```{r}
mcmc_dens(rbind(x, x+100))+
  geom_polygon(data=tibble(Value=c(-56.89950 , 15.1946, 15.1946, -56.89950), y=c(0,0,0.0104,0.0104)), aes(y=y), fill="cyan", alpha=1/3)+
  geom_polygon(data=tibble(Value=c(42.59036 , 115.0449, 115.0449, 42.59036), y=c(0,0,0.0104,0.0104)), aes(y=y), fill="cyan", alpha=1/3)+
  ggtitle("A density plot of 500 draws from a posterior distribution",
          subtitle = "with the cyan areas denoting 95% highest density interval [-56.90, 15.19; 42.59, 115.05]")
```

## Existence - $P_{D}$

```{r}
library(bayestestR)
p_direction(x) %>% 
  plot()+
  theme_classic()
```
- Probability of Direction: 0.93

## Existence - $P_{D}$


::: nonincremental

-  pd <= 95%: uncertain
-  pd > 95%: possibly existing
-  pd > 97%: likely existing
-  pd > 99%: probably existing
-  pd > 99.9%: certainly existing

:::

## Significance - $ROPE$

```{r}
rope(x, range=c(-10,10)) %>% 
  plot()+
  theme_classic()
```
- Proportion of samples inside ROPE: 22.88%

## Significance - $ROPE$

::: nonincremental

-  more than 99% in ROPE: negligible (we can accept the null hypothesis)
-  less than 97.5% in ROPE: probably negligible
-  <=97.5% & >= 2.5% in ROPE: undecided significance
-  <2.5% in ROPE: probably significant
-  <1% in ROPE: significant (we can reject the null hypothesis)
