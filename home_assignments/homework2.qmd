The dataset `ineq_women_pol` contains data from 31 countries about income inequalities (higher values = more inequality) and representation of women in politics (higher values = higher representation).

1. Conduct a classic correlation analysis (e.g., using a function `cor.test`), and describe what conclusion would you draw based on this data.
2. An object `post_cor` contains a posterior distribution from a Bayesian correlation analysis of the same dataset. Describe these results (point estimates and uncertainties) and conduct tests within a SEXIT (sequential effect existence and significance testing) framework.
3. Compare conclusions from both analyses. In what aspects do they agree/disagree?
4. Discuss what are pros and cons of both approaches.
